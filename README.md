# moticon_insoles

IMPORTANT NOTE: This package uses the Endpoint SDK from Moticon which is NOT FREE. You need to get a license for it and copy to the directory `src/moticon_insoles/sdk` or it will not work. 

We do implement an abstraction from their implementation, so in the future hopefully any insole which provides center of pressure (COP) and force values will be equivalent to this and able to provide improved GRFM estimation.
